<p style="color:black;">Hoop Mentality was founded by Matthew Ragland. Matthew has a vision to emphasize the passion of basketball to the online world. The culture of sports has given him the opportunity to play High school and years later play professionally in Spain. The Detroit Native is at the prime of his game, but his goal is to highlight the moment of everyone on the court.</p>
